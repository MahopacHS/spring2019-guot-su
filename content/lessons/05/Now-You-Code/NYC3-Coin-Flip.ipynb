The program should output\nthe tally of heads and tails across the number of flips.\n\nFor Example:\nAfter 100000 flips. Heads: 50030, Tails 49970\n\nOf course, since the flips are random, the counts will vary each time the program executes.\n\nYour strategy should be to use a loop to flip a coin 100,000 times.\nAfter you flip you should check for heads or tails and increment the count\naccordingly.\n\n### How do you make Python simulate a coin flip?"
