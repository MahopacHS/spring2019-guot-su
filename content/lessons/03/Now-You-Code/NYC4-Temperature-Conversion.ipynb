Would it be difficult to write a program which did the opposite (conversion F to C)? Explain.\nno because you can reverse the formula\n3. Did you store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line? I argue this makes your program easier to understand. Why?\nyes because you can see that F came from an equation "
